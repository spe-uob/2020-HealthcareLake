# Stakeholder Analysis

## Primary stakeholder
  
Philip Harfield at Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG (BNSSG). Philip Harfield is our client, and this software is being developed for him at BNSSG. BNSSG require a piece of software to store healthcare data from varius sources to inform clinical and strategic decisions. This means that BNSSG is our primary stakeholder.

## Additional stakeholders

This software will provide services to a number of local healthcare organisations such as NHS trusts and the Healthier Together STP and such all these additional users are secondary stakeholders to this project. These organisations will need to be able to provide healthcare information to the software which will need to be able to load and store the data for future analysis.
