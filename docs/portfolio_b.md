# Healthcare Data Lake

## Overview

## Stakeholder and Requirements

### Stakeholders

Philip Harfield is our client and primary stakeholder, and this software is being developed for him at Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire NHS CCG
(BNSSG). 

- The primary user story for this stakeholder is that BNSSG may require information about long-term data analytics from multiple sources. E.g how the long term health of patients has been affected by particular surgeries in childhood. This information could then be used to inform understanding of the merits of
previous clinical decisions taken.
- Additionally, another user story is it may require information in a more short term basis about the healthcare of the local population. E.g  to determine what percentage of people registered with a GP have been admitted to hospital in a given year. This information could then be used to inform strategic commissioning decisions on local healthcare services.
- Also BNSSG may want to use the software to curate datamarts from the data which can then be queried by external clients while maintaining security of the data lake. E.g A datamart could be curated of non-identifiable patient data of people who have had particular condition, so external research can be carried out on this condition without breaching data regulations. 





BNSSG require a piece of software that can be used to allow long-term
healthcare data analytics from multiple data sources to inform clinical
and strategic decisions. The reason for this is understanding the
longitudinal health of a patient allows understanding of the merits of
previous clinical decisions taken. In addition it can be used to inform
strategic commissioning decisions using data on how effective services
offered to patients have been.
